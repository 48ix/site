# Configuration Guides

## General Recommendations

### IPv4 ARP & IPv6 Neighbor Timeout

Each equipment vendor implements its own maximum ages for the IPv4 ARP and IPv6 neighbor caches. The values vary widely and in at least one case (Linux) it is not a constant. Low ARP timeouts can lead to excessive ARP traffic, especially if the values are lower than the BGP keepalive intervals.

Conversely, long timeouts can theoretically lead to longer downtime if you change equipment. This is because your peers' routers still have the old MAC address in their ARP cache.

We recommend setting the ARP cache timeout to at least two hours, preferably four. See the sections on specific equipment vendors for examples.

### Peering Network Prefix

The 48-IX Peering Network Prefix ( NEED PREFIX ) is part of ( NEED ASN ), and should **not** be globally routable. As such, the following guidelines should be followed when configuring your equipment:

- Do not configure `network < NEED PREFIX >` (or similar) in your router's BGP configuration.
- Do not redistribute the route, a supernet, or a more specific prefix outside of your AS. We ( NEED PREFIX ) announce it with a `no-export` community â€” please honor it.

### MTU

All 48-IX Exchange ports are configured with an MTU of `9216` bytes. It is recommended that member ports be configured with an MTU of `9000`, leaving enough overhead for future protocols which may be used by the exchange.

## Physical Connection

[48-IX policy dictates](interfaces.mdx) that only one MAC address is allowed behind a member port. This means that you'll need to be extremely careful when connecting a device that can act as a L2 device. Instabilities in a layer 2 network outside of our control can and typically do have a significant impact on the exchange as a whole. Bridging loops and spanning tree topology changes are good examples of this.

An intermediate L2 device may only bridge frames from the member's router to the 48-IX port, so that we see only one MAC address, and should otherwise be completely invisible. No connected device should bridge frames from other devices onto the 48-IX network, or send STP traffic on its 48-IX port.

### Connecting a Layer 3 Device

The most preferred way to connect to 48-IX is to directly connect a layer 3 device (router) to your cross connect. This nearly automatically ensures:

- Only a single MAC address is learned on the port (matching [our interface policy](interfaces.mdx))
- No STP traffic ingresses the port, removing any filtering overhead from the switch fabric
- Easier troubleshooting in the event of connectivity or traffic flow issues

### Connecting a Layer 2 Device

While we don't recommend connecting router router to 48-IX via an intermediate layer 2 device, keep the following mind should you choose to do so:

- You must guarantee that only traffic to/from your router's IX interface goes to/from the 48-IX port
- IGMP/MLD snooping on the intermediate switch may block legitimate ICMPv6 neighbor solicitations
- You must disable spanning tree on your port facing 48-IX.

We strongly recommend using a dedicated VLAN for the path from your router to the 48-IX port.
