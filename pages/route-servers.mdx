48 IX route servers run on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS virtual machines, with [FRRouting](https://frrouting.org/) as the routing daemon.

## ASN

48 IX operates two route servers, which are members of AS <ASN />, which is the 48 IX Peering ASN.

Each route server's peering IPv4 & IPv6 addresses are listed below:

| Route Server         | IPv4 Address |       IPv6 Address |
| :------------------- | -----------: | -----------------: |
| **rs1.phx.48ix.net** |  `192.0.2.1` | `2001:db8:48:1::1` |
| **rs2.phx.48ix.net** |  `192.0.2.2` | `2001:db8:48:1::2` |

## Routing Policy

48 IX automatically rejects the following BGP updates:

- Routes to a [bogon](bogons.mdx) network
- Routes with a [bogon](bogons.mdx) ASN in the `AS_PATH`
- RPKI-invalid routes
- Any update containing the AS number of any other 48 IX member in the `AS_PATH`

48 IX performs the following actions upon receiving a valid BGP update from a member router:

- Strip all BGP communities in the 48 IX namespace except those allowed for use by members
- Apply blackhole logic if blackhole community is attached
- Set Local Preference to `200`
- Set informational BGP communities
