## Interface settings

All Ethernet interfaces attached to 48 IX ports must be configured for auto-negotiation, unless a specific arrangement has been made otherwise.

## Allowed EtherTypes

Frames forwarded to 48 IX ports must have one of the following EtherTypes:

| EtherType | Protocol |
| :-------- | :------- |
| `0x0800`  | IPv4     |
| `0x0806`  | ARP      |
| `0x86dd`  | IPv6     |

## Unicast Traffic

Frames forwarded to 48 IX ports shall not be addressed to a multicast or broadcast MAC destination address except as follows:

- Broadcast ARP packets
- Multicast ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets

## Link-local traffic

Traffic related to link-local protocols will be filtered out on ingress, and will not be forwarded to other 48 IX ports. Link-local protocols include, but are not limited to, the following list:

- OSPF, ISIS, RIP, EIGRP
- Spanning Tree BPDUs
- ICMP redirects
- ICMPv6 Redirects
- ICMPv6 MLD
- CDP, LLDP, EDP
- L2 Keepalives
- PIM-SM/PIM-DM
- BOOTP/DHCP
- VTP, DTP
- UDLD

## Layer 4

Using application layer protocols to unleash malicious actions against other 48 IX customers over 48 IX infrastructure, is forbidden. 48 IX reserves the right to disable a member's port in case of complaints of attacks/abuse originating from such customers. The following list includes, but is not limited to:

- BGP hijacking
- DNS amplification/flood
- HTTP flood
- NTP amplification
- UDP flood
- ICMP flood

## Export of 48 IX Peering Networks

IP address space assigned to 48 IX Peering Networks must not be advertised to other networks without explicit permission of 48 IX. 48 IX reserves the right to disable the exchange port of any member found to be violating this policy, accidentally or intentionally, until the violation has been resolved.
