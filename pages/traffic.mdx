# Allowed Traffic

## Layer 1

### Interface settings

All Ethernet interfaces attached to 48-IX ports must be configured for auto-negotiation, unless a specific arrangement has been made otherwise.

## Layer 2

### Ethernet framing

Frames forwarded to 48-IX ports must have one of the following EtherTypes:

- `0x0800` IPv4
- `0x0806` ARP
- `0x86dd` IPv6

### No Proxy ARP

Use of Proxy ARP on a member router's interface to the Exchange is prohibited.

### Unicast only

Frames forwarded to 48-IX ports shall not be addressed to a multicast or broadcast MAC destination address except as follows:

- Broadcast ARP packets
- Multicast ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets. Please note that this does _not_ include Router Solicitation or Advertisement packets.

### No link-local traffic

Traffic related to link-local protocols will be filtered out on ingress, and will not be forwarded to other 48-IX ports. Link-local protocols include, but are not limited to, the following list:

- ICMP redirects
- IEEE 802 Spanning Tree
- Discovery protocols: CDP, EDP
- VLAN/trunking protocols: VTP, DTP
- Interior routing protocol broadcasts (e.g. OSPF, ISIS, RIP, EIGRP)
- BOOTP/DHCP
- PIM-SM/PIM-DM
- ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery
- ICMPv6 Router Solicitation
- UDLD
- L2 Keepalives

The following link-local protocols are exceptions and are allowed:

- ARP
- IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

## Layer 3

### Export of 48-IX Peering Networks

IP address space assigned to 48-IX Peering Networks must not be advertised to other networks without explicit permission of 48-IX. 48-IX reserves the right to disable the Exchange port of any member found to be violating this policy, accidentally or intentionally, until the violation has been resolved.

## Layer 4

Using application layer protocols to unleash malicious actions against other 48-IX customers over 48-IX infrastructure, is forbidden. 48-IX reserves the right to disable a member's port in case of complaints of attacks/abuse originating from such customers. The following list includes, but is not limited to:

- BGP hijacking
- DNS amplification/flood
- HTTP flood
- NTP amplification
- UDP flood
- ICMP flood
