We strive to make 48 IX an open _exchange_ of both internet traffic and ideas. It's **critically important** to us that members can easily communicate with one another and with the 48 IX management team about any problems or feedback relative to the exchange.

## Email

Upon initial registration, members must designate the contact types defined in the [Connection Policy](connection-policy.mdx#communication) in order to facilitate adequate communication regarding maintenance, policy changes, or other important notifications. _**We are vehemently against email spam**_, and as such will keep email communications to a minimum.

In order to segment outbound communications from 48 IX into manageable groups, we've established the following subscription groups:

- **member-maintenance**: Members-only announcement list for maintenance notifications. This should probably go to an infrastructure team's distribution list, or wherever you would normally have your peers or upstream providers send their maintenance notifications.
- **public-announce**: Announcement list for non-technical & non-maintenance notifications, available to the public. Examples include new member notifications, policy changes, new facility notifications, etc. As a member or potential member, this should probably go to your organization's peering contact, or whomever manages peer & provider relationships.

## Slack

48 IX also operates a Slack Group, if IM is more your speed.
