# Membership Fees

48 IX aims to keep membership fees as low as possible. Any excess profit collected from membership fees is put back into improving the IX through new hardware, features, or locations.

Fees are calculated on a **per-port basis**, and may be collected on an annual or monthly basis, whichever the member prefers.
