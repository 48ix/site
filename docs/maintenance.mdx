To ensure our uptime and security goals are met, we regularly perform maintenance and upgrades on the exchange platform. Such upgrades are always carried out in the least-disruptive manner possible, and always during the following maintenance windows:

## Non-disruptive Maintenance

Mondays to Fridays between **22:00** and **00:00** hours MST.

## Disruptive Maintenance

Saturday or Sunday between **08:00** and **10:00** hours MST.

Scheduled maintenance is always announced to the **member-maintenance** [mailing list](communication.mdx).

## Communication

Scheduled maintenance is always announced to the relevant mailing lists at least 72 hours before it is taking place. However, hardware or software failure may occasionally require unscheduled maintenance in order to repair. In such cases, an Emergency Maintenance window may be scheduled or commence immediately, depending on the severity. Every effort will be made to notify members of such an event as quickly as possible.
