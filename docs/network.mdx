## Locations

48 IX is currently available in the following locations:

| Facility Name       | Facility ID | Metro ID |                            Address |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :------- | ---------------------------------: |
| EdgeConneX ECDPHX01 | `01`        | `01`     | 3011 S. 52nd St., Tempe, AZ, 85282 |

The **Facility ID** is used throughout 48 IX for identification and locational purposes.

## Peering Network

48 IX utilizes unique IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned by ARIN for the peering LAN:

| Prefix             | Description        |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| `149.112.3.0/24`   | Peering LAN IPv4 1 |
| `2001:504:14::/64` | Peering LAN IPv6 1 |

## Routing

48 IX utilizes <ASN /> for all multilateral BGP adjacencies. <ASN /> Should never appear in the `AS_PATH` of routes received from the route servers.

### Route Servers

| Route Server     | IPv4 Address  | IPv6 Address     |                            Platform |
| :--------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | ----------------------------------: |
| **rs1.48ix.net** | `149.112.3.1` | `2001:504:14::1` | [FRRouting](https://frrouting.org/) |
| **rs2.48ix.net** | `149.112.3.2` | `2001:504:14::2` | [FRRouting](https://frrouting.org/) |

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Forwarding"
  message="48 IX route servers are not in the forwarding path, and have IPv4 & IPv6 forward explicitly disabled."
/>

### Route Filtering

The following BGP updates are automatically rejected:

- Routes to a [bogon](bogons.mdx) network
- Routes with a [bogon](bogons.mdx) ASN in the `AS_PATH`
- RPKI-invalid routes

The following actions are performed upon receiving a valid BGP update from a multilateral peer:

- Strip all BGP communities in the <ASN /> namespace except those allowed for participant use
- Set Local Preference to `200`
- Set informational BGP communities

### BGP Communities

48 IX leverages BGP Communities to provide participants with the ability to control how their routes are announced to other multilateral participants.

#### Well Known Communities

The following well-known BGP communities are supported:

| Community   | Name                                                    |                                                                             Action |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `65535:1`   | [**NO_EXPORT**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1997)    |    Export the route to all participants, with the **NO_EXPORT** community attached |
| `65535:2`   | [**NO_ADVERTISE**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1997) | Export the route to all participants, with the **NO_ADVERTISE** community attached |
| `65535:666` | [**BLACKHOLE**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7999)    |    Export the route to all participants, with the **BLACKHOLE** community attached |

#### Informational Communities

The following communities will be appended to any route received on a 48-IX route server, and may be used for granular route filtering or other informational purposes:

| Community       | Name                                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `62484:0`       | **Any**: Any route that has traversed <ASN/>                                                               |
| `62484:64810:x` | **Route Server ID**: `x` is equal to the [Route Server ID](#route-servers) on which the route was received |
| `62484:64820:x` | **Location**: `x` is equal to the [Facility ID](#locations)                                                |
| `62484:64830:x` | **Metro ID**: `x` is equal to the [Metro ID](#locations)                                                   |
| `62484:64840:x` | **Participant ID**: `x` is equal to the [Participant ID](participants.mdx)                                 |
| `62484:62484:x` | **Participant ASN**: `x` is equal to the [Participant ASN](participants.mdx)                               |

#### Community Filtering

To mitigate community "noise", all BGP communities not specified in this document are deleted from inbound BGP updates, and only communities in the [Informational Communities](#informational-communities) section are exported.

The only exception to this are [Well Known Communities](#well-known-communities) â€” all supported well-known BGP communities are maintained on outbound updates.
